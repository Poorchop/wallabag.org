I want transparency with you.

This post is here to tell you how much does poche cost, how much does poche earn.


## How does poche cost?




### Hosting


From April to October, poche was hosted on a OVH Kimsufi server, which costs 19,12 € per month. Cost: 229,44€. The server hosted 3 personal websites. Cost only for poche (pro rata) = 229,44 / 4 = **57,36€**.

Since October, Web4all offers a [Pack Start](https://www.web4all.fr/hebergements.html): thank you so much, guys!


### Domain name


I bought inthepoche.com at gandi.net: **15,00€**.


### Emailing


poche uses [Mailjet](http://mailjet.com) for [poche hosting](http://app.inthepoche.com).  Since few days, the free plan is not enough. Mailjet offered the Bronze plan for 3 months: thank you so much!
