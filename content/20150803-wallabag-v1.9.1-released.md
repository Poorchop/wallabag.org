title: wallabag v1.9.1 released, last version before v2!

We are happy to announce you the release of wallabag v1.9.1. Unlike what it seems, it's quite an important version (it's just between 1.9 and 2.0). A whole number of bugs have been corrected, some translations added, many config websites files added, and there's also a handful of new features we hope you'll like.

## Download 

wallabag 1.9.1 is [available on our website](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html).

## Features
* Buttons to go to next and previous article when you view an article.
* Button to mark article as read and go to next unread article.
* Keyboard shortcuts. Lots of them. And vim-style navigation. Check them out here.
* Gestures on touch screens. Swipe to left or right to navigate to next or previous articles.
* Toolbar also at the bottom of the article with baggy theme, you don't have to scroll back any more when finished !
* While you tag an article, you now see all the existing tags. Just click on them to add it to this article. And the more used are shown bigger.
* Mozilla Sharing Service ! You will need https to activate it, but it's worth the try, you can get rid of the old extension and use the build-in sharing from Firefox.
* Import *Netscape-formated-bookmarks*. This allows import of Firefox, Internet Explorer (I know, right !), Chrome browsers bookmarks. And certainly many other tools and applications.
* If you're using a reverse proxy, you might interested by the BASE_URL constant.

* `d` or `del` to delete article
* `f` to toggle favorite status
* `m` to toggle mark as read status
* `n` to mark as read and redirect to the next article

#### Unread / Favorite / Archive view
* with arrows, you can navigate into articles (vim style is also available with `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) and press Enter to read the article!

## Session issues
It's no secret that we've had kind of a hard deal to fix sessions issues. You always ended up disconnected after a while. The thing is, just a little configuration should get rid of this issues. [Checkout the documentation there](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/Administrator/sessions.html).

This bug is already fixed on Framabag.org. 

## Application for Firefox OS

We **now** have our Firefox OS application! Thank you so much [@freddyb](https://github.com/freddyb) !

## wallabag v2

This is the end of wallabag [as we know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY). ~~We launch our premium version~~ We get rid of the old code. We've rebuild wallabag using Symfony2 and it's now much better to work efficiently with clean code.

We will release a first alpha release of wallabag 2.0 in september 2015. You can follow latest news on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wallabagapp), [gitter](https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag#initial) or [diaspora*](https://framasphere.org/u/wallabag).
