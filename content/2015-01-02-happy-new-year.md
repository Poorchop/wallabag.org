title: Happy new year!

All our team wishes you a happy new year!

The last year was ... incredible. [We changed our name](https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2014/01/27/lets-go), some great websites talk about us, wallabag was downloaded 15.000 times, more than 3.200 accounts were [created on Framabag](https://www.framabag.org), etc.

For 2015, we want to release wallabag v2, which will be a great new version. We already have some interesting contacts for adding interactions between wallabag and other softwares. Stay tuned!

I really want to thank you all our contributors, more particularly [Thomas Citharel](https://github.com/tcitworld) and [mariroz](https://github.com/mariroz). Without them, all the done work would be impossible.

In next weeks, I hope we'll have great news to announce ...

See you soon,

Nicolas
