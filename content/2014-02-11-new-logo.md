Thanks to [Maylis Agniel](https://twitter.com/mmaayylliiss), wallabag has now its own logo.

You can see here a sympathetic wallaby.

_(as for the name, you don't have to like it ;-) but we love it!)_

You can download it here [https://github.com/wallabag/logo](https://github.com/wallabag/logo)

Now, all is ready to work and to go forward!

We also changed the website design, but it's not the definitive one. We will maybe work on it in next weeks.
