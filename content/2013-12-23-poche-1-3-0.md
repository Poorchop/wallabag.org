I'm so happy to announce the latest release of poche. There are so many changes with this version!


## New features




### RSS


You can now read your poched links with your RSS agregator, e-reader, etc. In your config screen, you now have three RSS feeds for unread, favorites and archived links.


### Tags


When you're reading a link, you can now add tags to it. It's now so easy to tidy your poche. And if you enabled RSS, you can also have a feed per tag..


### So many new things





	
  * You can poche youtube videos

	
  * Persian language has been added

	
  * You can download your poche database (only if you use SQLite storage).

	
  * When you check the checkbox "Stay signed in", you stay signed in!
