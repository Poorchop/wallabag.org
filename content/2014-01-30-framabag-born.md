Since August 2013, you can create a free account, we install an update the application for you. You "only" have to use it.

Few days ago, [Framasoft](http://www.framasoft.net) contacted me: why not integrate our system into Framasoft network?

> **Framasoft** is an association that promotes open source.

I am so proud to announce **Framabag** (Framasoft + wallabag): [http://www.framabag.org](http://www.framabag.org)
