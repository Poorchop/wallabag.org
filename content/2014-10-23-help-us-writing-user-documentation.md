You aren't a developer, but you want to help us? You can now write user documentation!

We created a new repository on github: [https://github.com/wallabag/documentation](https://github.com/wallabag/documentation)

One folder per language. All this documentation is written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Today, these files are only accessible there, but we'll generate HTML documentation which will be published on our website (here: [http://doc.wallabag.org/](http://doc.wallabag.org/)).

This documentation is a user documentation, not a technical one. We'll explain all wallabag's features. All the documentation is not yet written, we are working on it, but you can start translating.

**Don't wait and fork our documentation repository! **
