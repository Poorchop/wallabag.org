tags: release, v1

Six months. Between the first commit (April 3, 2013) and the 1.0.0 (October 3, 2013), six months.

The 1.0.0 is now released.

A new website is here. More complete, more convenient.

To download poche and third-party applications, [it’s here](http://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html).

Thank you so much to all of you: [contributors](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/graphs/contributors), [bugs finders](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues), [framabag](https://www.framabag.org/) and “self-hosted” users, [followers](http://twitter.com/wallabagapp), etc.

And a huge thanks to my wife. Without her, this project would not be where it is today.

Have fun with poche.
