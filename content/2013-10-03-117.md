title: poche 1.0.0
tags: release, v1

Six months. Between the first commit (April 3, 2013) and the 1.0.0 (October 3, 2013), six months.

The 1.0.0 is now released.

A new website is here. More complete, more convenient.

To download poche and third-party applications, [it’s here](http://www.inthepoche.com/download).

Thank you so much to all of you: [contributors](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/graphs/contributors), [bugs finders](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/issues), [poche hosting](http://app.inthepoche.com/) and “self-hosted” users, [followers](http://twitter.com/getpoche), etc.

And a huge thanks to my wife. Without her, this project would not be where it is today.

Have fun with poche.
