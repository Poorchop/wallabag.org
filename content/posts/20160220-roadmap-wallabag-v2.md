title: Roadmap for wallabag v2
tags: v2

As you saw last weeks, we worked very hard on wallabag v2 and we released two alpha ([alpha.1]({filename}20160108-wallabag-alpha1-v2.md) and [alpha.2]({filename}20160220-wallabag-alpha2-v2.md)).

Today, we can try to have a real roadmap for this year. [You can follow our roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/milestones), we update it very often.

## First beta

We planned to released our first public beta on **1st March**.

We still [have some issues to fix and pull requests to merge](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/milestones/2.0.0-beta.1) in the 10 days to come. If some issues won't be fixed, it's not a problem to release the beta version (we can move the issues to an other release).

During one month, you'll be invited to try this beta, we'll fix some bugs but we won't add any more features.

## Other betas?

If it's necessary (and I'm sure it'll be), we'll release other beta versions.

## Final version

Wow :') Finally.

I can announce you that we want to release this version, 2.0, on the **3rd of April** (wallabag birthday, it will be 3 years old!).

Maybe dates will change (wallabag is a volunteer project, we also have other priorities), but we'll do everything we can to **release wallabag v2 on the 3rd of April**.

## How can you help us?

Test, test and test! [Download wallabag v2 on this page](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html) and tell us if you have any problems.

Don't forget that [you can also support us via Paypal, Flattr, Gratipay or Bountysource](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations.html).

Have a nice day!
