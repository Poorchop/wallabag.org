title: First public beta for wallabag v2
tags: v2, release

Last week, [we published our roadmap]({filename}/20160220-roadmap-wallabag-v2.md) for this year:

* wallabag v2.0.0-beta.1 on 1st March
* wallabag v2.0.0 on 3rd April
* wallabag v2.1.0 on 3rd July
* wallabag v2.2.0 on 3rd October

And do you know what? **We are on 1st March**. So, it's the **beta day**!

## wallabag v2.0.0-beta.1

If you missed our recent blog posts, here are the main features of wallabag v2:

* a REST API ([you can have a look to the documentation](http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc))
* authorization via oAuth2
* a new default theme, called `material`
* save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. (Hopefully)
* annotations: In each article you read, you can write annotations. ([read the doc](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/annotations.html))
* assign tags to entries
* edit article titles
* RSS feeds (with ability to limit number of articles)
* create a new account from the config page
* filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc.
* recover passwords from login page (you have to fill your email on config page)
* picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry
* Public registration
* migration from wallabag v1/v2 (based on JSON export) ([read the doc](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/import.html))
* migration from Pocket (it works, but we need to implement asynchronous import: if you have too many articles, it can fail) ([read the doc](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/import.html))
* exports in many formats (PDF, JSON, EPUB, MOBI, XML, CSV and TXT).
* 2-Factor authentication via email ([read the doc](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/configuration.html#two-factor-authentication))
* Tagging rule: create a rule to automatically assign tags to entries! ([read the doc](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/configuration.html#tagging-rules))
* German, French, Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, Danish and English translations
* Added Quickstart for beginners (when you don't have any entries)
* maintenance mode (useful when you'll upgrade your wallabag platform)
* Internal settings for administrator (the account created during installation). We need to documentate this part of wallabag.

We have work to do on our API, [you can have a look on this pull request](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/pull/1675).

### What's new since last alpha?

* The big feature is the annotations. [Thank you Thomas](https://github.com/tcitworld)!
* We worked on installation: it's now easier (we removed many parameters to configure during this step) and we check more requirements to facilitate this installation
* Internal settings for administrator
* Maintenance mode
* Turkish, Persian, Romanian, Polish, and Danish translations (thank you to translators)
* Piwik integration

We didn't write database migrations for this first beta, but this feature is planned for next versions.  
If you want to upgrade your previous installation, please run this command `bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force`.

You can see the full changelog here: [https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/compare/2.0.0-alpha.2...2.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/compare/2.0.0-alpha.2...2.0.0-beta.1).

### Documentation

v2 documentation is already available (we still need to write some chapters), you can read it here: http://doc.wallabag.org

Our documentation is now hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://readthedocs.org/).

### Translate wallabag and documentation

Please read this page: [http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/developer/translate.html](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/developer/translate.html).

### Third-party applications

Our applications (Firefox / Chrome addons and Android / iOS / Windows Phone) are not available for wallabag v2 but we'll work on them to change that.

## Test wallabag

Keep in mind it's a **beta** branch, don't use it in production.

### On a dedicated web server

If you don't have it yet, please [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Then you can install wallabag by executing the following commands:

```
SYMFONY_ENV=prod composer create-project wallabag/wallabag wallabag "2.0.0-beta.1" --no-dev
php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod
php bin/console server:run --env=prod
```

### On a shared hosting

We provide you a package, `wallabag-2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz`, with all dependancies inside.

The default configuration uses SQLite for the database. If you want to change these settings, please edit `app/config/parameters.yml`.

**Warning:** With this package, wallabag don't check mandatory extensions used in the application (theses checks are made during `composer create-project` when you have a dedicated web server, see above).  
**[Please read our installation documentation to see requirements](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/installation.html)**.

* Download this file here: [http://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package](http://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package)
* Extract it (`tar xvf wallabag-2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz`)
* In your wallabag folder, run `php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod`
* Run `php bin/console server:run --env=prod`

### On our demo platform

We published this version on [http://v2.wallabag.org](http://v2.wallabag.org) but please remind it's just a demo platform and we can drop database at any time.

You can create a free account on this platform.

### Need help?

[We are on Gitter](https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag) (a chat platform), ping us! You can also open a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/new).

## How can you help us?

Test, test and test! Install wallabag v2 (see above `On a dedicated web server` chapter) and tell us if you have any problems.

Don't forget that [you can also support us via Paypal, Flattr, Gratipay or Bountysource](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations.html).

## What's next?

We planned to released stable version on 3rd April. In one month. We have lot of work to release this version ([see here our todo list](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/milestones/2.0.0)). Maybe we'll release other betas before this deadline (the next version will probably be a Release Candidate, it depends on the quantity of bugs you'll find!).

We need help, feel free to contribute to this great project!
