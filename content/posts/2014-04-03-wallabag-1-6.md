title: wallabag 1.6 is here!
tags: release, v1

[One year ago](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/commit/1a268ba710b2cdb4ede98af3368c43d66c4c5e53), I pushed the first files of poche, now wallabag.

That's why I'm so happy to announce **wallabag 1.6 "Happy birthday!"** today. This release is so great. New features and lots of bugs fixed.

Download it here: [https://www.wallabag.org/downloads/](https://www.wallabag.org/downloads/)
To update your wallabag, just extract the archive in your folder and clear your cache (on config page). [Don't forget to read the documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org/doku.php?id=wallabag:installing_wallabag#upgrading).

Framabag will be updated soon.

Thank you Skibbi, mariroz, Draky50110, Tcitworld, camporez, kevmeyer, bobmaerten, thomaslebeau for this release.
