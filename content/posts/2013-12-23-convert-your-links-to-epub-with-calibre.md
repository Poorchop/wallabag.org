tags: documentation, epub, v1

FaustXVI released a great tool, **poche-to-calibre**: this project is a script for calibre in order to get poche bookmarks in epub format so you can read it later, off-line, on your e-reader.

If you want to use it, just download it here: [https://github.com/FaustXVI/poche-to-calibre](https://github.com/FaustXVI/poche-to-calibre)

Thank you FaustXVI!
