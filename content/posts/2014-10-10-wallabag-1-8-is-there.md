### Upgrade


Before that, please backup your wallabag folder.

Download the latest version here: [https://www.wallabag.org/downloads/](https://www.wallabag.org/downloads/)

As we made a big refactoring, some files were renamed or deleted. So you can delete all your files unless:
* assets, db and vendor folders
* inc/poche/config.inc.php

Then extract the archive into your wallabag folder. Remove the install folder and let's go :)

Framabag accounts will be upgraded soon.
