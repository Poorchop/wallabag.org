Our renaming history changed lot of things in our project.And the least we can say is that it has also changed my life.

Few weeks ago, Madan Nagaldinne, head of human resources at Facebook, contacted me to discuss about a project that the american firm has for several years: the possibility to save articles to read them later.

Put yourself in my place, I'm not a fan of this social network, but if I can be able to provide my family a very decent lifestyle is interesting. So without much hesitation, I accepted this new mission.

However, I had some conditions:



	
  * to leave the project open source

	
  * to still code it in PHP


Facebook answers:

	
  * Facebook and open source projects are not incompatible. Most of projects are still open source: [https://code.facebook.com/projects/](https://code.facebook.com/projects/)

	
  * PHP is a major language at Facebook. Last news: Hack: a new programming language for HHVM [http://code.facebook.com/posts/264544830379293/hack-a-new-programming-language-for-hhvm/](http://code.facebook.com/posts/264544830379293/hack-a-new-programming-language-for-hhvm/)


I expected some administrative confirmations before talking to you about this great new. But Facebook didn’t wait and already communicated: Facebook Takes Another Crack At Read-It-Later With “Save” Button [http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/27/facebook-save/](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/27/facebook-save/)

I'll start my new mission in mid-April, I’ll be attached to the french Facebook team with some trips in California from my first days to meet my future colleagues.

I give you more news in the coming days, I have to go prepare my boxes for the move.
