Hi there!

Just a little post to tell you we are working on poche v2. Since last week, the [v2 branch](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/commits/v2-silex) changed a lot.

You can test this branch here: [http://v2.inthepoche.com/](http://v2.inthepoche.com/)

You can poche and read an article, star / archive and delete it.

If you are PHP developer, you can contact us (for your information, we choosed [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) for poche v2).

See you later!
