title: First commit for poche v2
tags: v2

I just commited the code of v2. I use the light framework created by Frédéric Guillot, the creator of Miniflux [https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/tree/v2](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/tree/v2)

Thank you to Frédéric Guillot for your framework, it works very well. #poche v2 has many new features thanks to you.

RSS, Tags, API, Search engine, Keyboard shortcuts, plugins system (import from poche v1/pocket/cie, export to pdf, etc.), multi users: all these features are already available. And many other great features are planned

An API will be available. This means that #poche will be able to grow well.

You can already migrate from #poche v1 to v2: export your datas in config screen and put poche.json in /data of v2 and use the import plugin

But be careful, the v2 is not usable in production.
