wallabag is a **self hostable application for saving web pages**. Unlike other services, wallabag is free (as in freedom) and open source.

With this application you will not miss content anymore. **Click, save, read it when you want**. It saves the content you select so that you can read it when you have time.

## How it works

Thanks to the bookmarklet or [third-party applications](/pages/download-wallabag.html), you save an article to your wallabag to read it later. Then, when you open your wallabag, **you can comfortably read your articles**.

## How to use wallabag

There are two ways to use wallabag: [you can install it on your web server](/pages/download-wallabag.html) or you can [create a free account at Framabag](https://www.framabag.org/). Framabag is a [<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6a5687;">Frama</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eb7e41;">soft</span>](http://www.framasoft.net) service.
