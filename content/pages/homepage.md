wallabag is a **self hostable application for saving web pages**. Unlike other services, wallabag is free (as in freedom) and [open source](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/blob/v2/COPYING.md).

With this application you will not miss content anymore. **Click, save, read it when you want**. It saves the content you select so that you can read it when you have time.
