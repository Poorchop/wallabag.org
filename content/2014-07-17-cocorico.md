We are proud to launch a french version of our website. You can read it here: [http://fr.wallabag.org](http://fr.wallabag.org)

Because we are mainly a french team, because Framabag is a Framasoft service (who is an association that promotes open source), we wanted to have a french website. 

Documentation, blog, you will find almost the same website ... but in french.

Rendez-vous sur [fr.wallabag.org](http://fr.wallabag.org) !
