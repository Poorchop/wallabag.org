Hello everybody, 

We are proud to launch a new website. We want to make contributions easier and thus decided to drop Wordpress. We moved to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) instead, a great static site generator.

There are several advantages with this new engine as you'll see them in the coming weeks.

The webdesign was kept very simple as it isn't our priority: we want to have this great tool for publishing.

Our new RSS feed is [https://www.wallabag.org/feeds/all.atom.xml](https://www.wallabag.org/feeds/all.atom.xml).
