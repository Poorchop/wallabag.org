Hello everybody, 

**We are proud to launch a new website**. We left wordpress to generate our website, in order to make easier the collaboration on it. 

We choosed [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a great tool to generate static website. 

**We have several advantages with this new website**. You'll see it in next weeks. 

The webdesign is very simple, it wasn't not our priority: we wanted to have this great tool for publishing.

Our new RSS feed is [https://www.wallabag.org/feeds/all.atom.xml](https://www.wallabag.org/feeds/all.atom.xml).
