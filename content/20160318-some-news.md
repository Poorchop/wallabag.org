We published several blog posts about our releases during last weeks.  
It's time to talk about other topics.

### PHP Tour, a french tech event

[Jérémy](https://twitter.com/j0k) and [I](https://twitter.com/nicosomb) will be at PHP Tour (at Clermont-Ferrand, France), a french event based on PHP talks. We'll discuss about wallabag v2 and the framework we used: Symfony.

### Stickers

We ordered 500 wallabag stickers. We'll send one of these to each of [our Paypal donator](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9UBA65LG3FX9Y&lc=gb). But if you'll come to PHP Tour, I'm sure I'll have some stickers to give.

[We also opened a shop](http://wallabag.spreadshirt.fr/en). You can order mugs, badges or a nice hoodie like this one:

Have a nice day, we still have great features to add into wallabag v2!
